### 1. Radiation pattern with driven element Directors and Reflector

#### Vertical Pattern & Horizontal pattern

Radiation pattern moves towards the directors because the reflector pushes the radiation and directors grab those radiations.

### 2. Radiation pattern only with the Driven element

#### Vertical Pattern & Horizontal Pattern

When there is no reflector and Directors the radiation pattern gets a symmetrical shape.

### 3. Radiation Pattern with Driven element and the Reflector

#### Vertical Pattern & Horizontal Pattern

When a reflector is added to the antenna, the radiation moves to the other side from the driven element because it pushes the radiation.

### 4. Radiation Pattern with Driven element and Directors

#### Vertical Pattern & Horizontal Pattern

When we add directors, the radiation intensity of that area gets increased.

### Effect by the Directors

| Num. of Directors | Min Val (dBi) | Max Val (dBi) |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------|
| 4                 | -32.5         | 11.9          |
| 3                 | -35           | 11.6          |
| 2                 | -32.8         | 11.1          |
| 1                 | -31.5         | 9.06          |

When the number of directors increased, the radiation level gets high. We can see a radiation increase at the reflectorâ€™s side when we do this. Maximum and the minimum level of Output Directivity also varies as mentioned in the above table.
